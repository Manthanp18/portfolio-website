  aboutme:
    'I am a self-taught developer. I completed my bachelors in commerce. In this COVID lockdown, I started learning web development and got my hands on it. There was always a spark in me to play with computers and tech overall, which led me to start learning to build web applications. I mostly used Udemy to learn and enhance my skills. In this past year or so I learned MERN stack. To practice my learnings I tried building a couple of tiny projects which has been pushed on Github. I am a quick learner and a tech enthusiast who loves to solve problems with technology. To start off my career I am looking for a full-time job where I can learn, grow and contribute to companies growth. ',
